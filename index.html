                Hi! My name is Olivia Kory. I was born in Spokane Washington, and have lived all
                over the United States. I have a passion for writing fictional stories and creating art through digital mediums. I'm the oldest of three children, with a younger
                brother currently away on a mission in Mexico, and a younger sister who just started her senior year of high school. I currently live with my mother, who decided it would be
                fun to go to school alongside me. Since it's just the two of us in the house, we like to spend our evenings together watching TV or just vegging out. One day, I'd love 
                to get into video game coding, as I've long been fascinated with the process, and have played with the idea of creating my own video game for a while now. I can't
                think of much else to say about myself, so I'm, going to give you some spider facts, since I love spiders! Jumping spiders are part of the largest group of spiders on Earth
                with over 6,200 species to count all over the world. They have amazing eyesight and are even able to memorize human faces. They're incredibly intelligent for a spider and can
                be trained to jump on command.
